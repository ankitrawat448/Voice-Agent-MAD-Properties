━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018, MAD Apartments is legally responsible for maintaining:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Tenants are responsible for:

- Unblocking sinks, baths, and toilets that have been blocked by tenant usage

SECTION 4 — HOW REPAIRS ARE CARRIED OUT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1. Complaint logged via the voice hotline, online portal, or in writing.
2. Maintenance team acknowledges within the SLA window and contacts the tenant to arrange access.
3. All repair work is carried out by qualified contractors vetted by MAD Apartments. Contractors carry photo ID and must show it on request.
4. Tenant must provide reasonable access. MAD Apartments will give at least 24 hours' notice for non-emergency visits, except in emergencies where immediate access is required.
5. After completion, the tenant is asked to confirm the issue is resolved before the ticket is closed.
6. If the work is not satisfactory, the tenant can raise a follow-up complaint and the ticket will be reopened at no additional delay.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 5 — COSTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

- All repairs that are the landlord's responsibility are carried out at no cost to the tenant.
- If a repair is found to be the result of tenant negligence or misuse, the tenant will be notified in writing before any costs are charged, and will have the right to dispute.
- Emergency repairs required outside normal hours carry no surcharge for the tenant.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 6 — DAMP AND MOULD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Following the Awaab's Law provisions under the Renters' Reform Bill, MAD Apartments treats damp and mould as a serious hazard.

Investigation timeline:
- Initial survey arranged within 3 working days of complaint
- Written report issued to tenant within 7 days of survey
- Remediation works begin within 14 days of report
- All works completed within a timeframe agreed in writing with the tenant

Tenants are not charged for damp or mould treatment unless it is proven to have been caused entirely by the tenant's lifestyle (e.g. never opening windows, drying laundry on radiators without ventilation). Even then, MAD Apartments will assist and advise before attributing costs.
