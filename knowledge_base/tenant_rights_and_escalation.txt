VERSION: 2.0  |  EFFECTIVE: January 2026

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 1 — YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS AS A TENANT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

As a tenant of MAD Apartments, you have the following legal rights under UK law:

RIGHT TO HABITABLE ACCOMMODATION
Under the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018, your home must be fit to live in at the start of and throughout your tenancy. This includes being free from hazards such as damp, mould, structural problems, and faulty heating.

RIGHT TO REPAIRS
Under Section 11 of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, your landlord must keep in repair:
- The structure and exterior of the property
- Installations for heating, hot water, gas, water, and electricity
Your landlord must carry out repairs within a reasonable time after being notified of the fault.

RIGHT TO QUIET ENJOYMENT
You have the right to live in your home without unreasonable interference from the landlord or their contractors. MAD Apartments must give at least 24 hours' written notice before entering, except in genuine emergencies.

RIGHT TO INFORMATION
You have the right to know the name and address of your landlord, the gas safety certificate (renewed annually), the electrical installation condition report (every 5 years), and the Energy Performance Certificate.

RIGHT NOT TO BE HARASSED OR ILLEGALLY EVICTED
Any attempt to force you to leave your home through harassment, withdrawal of services, or illegal eviction is a criminal offence under the Protection from Eviction Act 1977.

SECTION 2 — COMPLAINT ESCALATION PROCEDURE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If you are unhappy with how a complaint has been handled, follow these escalation steps:

STAGE 1 — HOTLINE COMPLAINT
Contact the MAD Apartments complaint hotline (this service). A ticket will be created and acknowledged. Response times are as set out in the Maintenance & Repairs Policy.

STAGE 2 — FORMAL WRITTEN COMPLAINT
If the issue is not resolved to your satisfaction within the SLA, or if you feel the handling was inadequate, submit a formal written complaint to:
  complaints@madapartments.co.uk
or by post to:
  MAD Apartments Complaints Team, 1 Property Lane, London, E1 0AB

We will acknowledge your written complaint within 3 working days and provide a full written response within 10 working days.

STAGE 3 — PROPERTY MANAGER REVIEW
If you are not satisfied with the Stage 2 response, you may request a review by the senior property manager. This review will be completed within 15 working days.

STAGE 4 — HOUSING OMBUDSMAN
If the issue remains unresolved after Stage 3, or if 8 weeks have passed since your Stage 2 complaint was submitted, you may refer your complaint to the Housing Ombudsman Service, which is free and independent:
  Website: www.housing-ombudsman.org.uk
  Phone:   0300 111 3000
  Post:    Housing Ombudsman Service, PO Box 152, Liverpool, L33 7WQ

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 3 — WHAT HAPPENS IF REPAIRS ARE NOT DONE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If MAD Apartments fails to carry out repairs within a reasonable time after being notified, tenants have the following options:

RENT WITHHOLDING — Not recommended as a first step and carries legal risk. Seek advice before doing this.

REPAIR AND DEDUCT — In some circumstances you may be entitled to arrange and pay for repairs yourself and deduct the cost from rent. This requires specific legal conditions to be met. Seek advice from Shelter or Citizens Advice first.

HOUSING DISREPAIR CLAIM — If a landlord has failed to carry out repairs and this has caused damage to your health or belongings, you may be entitled to compensation through a housing disrepair claim in the County Court.

LOCAL AUTHORITY INSPECTION — You can ask your local council to inspect the property under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System (HHSRS). If a hazard is found, the council can issue a formal improvement notice requiring the landlord to act.

SECTION 5 — NOISE AND NEIGHBOUR COMPLAINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Noise complaints are handled under MAD Apartments' Noise and Nuisance Policy:

- All noise complaints are formally logged and the relevant party is notified within 24 hours.
- Tenants found to be causing persistent nuisance may receive a formal warning letter.
- Repeated or severe noise nuisance may be treated as a breach of tenancy and can result in eviction proceedings.
- For noise outside of MAD Apartments' control (e.g. street noise, neighbouring properties not managed by MAD), tenants may contact the local council's Environmental Health team.
- Quiet hours at MAD Apartments properties: 11pm to 7am on weekdays, 11pm to 9am on weekends.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 6 — PEST AND INFESTATION COMPLAINTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MAD Apartments is responsible for pest control where an infestation:
- Pre-existed the tenancy
- Is caused by the building's structure (e.g. entry points in walls or foundations)
- Affects communal areas of the building

Tenants are responsible for pest control where the infestation is directly caused by the tenant's actions (e.g. leaving food out, poor waste management). In these cases, MAD Apartments will advise and assist but the tenant may be asked to contribute to costs.

All pest complaints are responded to within 48 hours with an inspection. Treatments are arranged with a qualified pest control firm.
