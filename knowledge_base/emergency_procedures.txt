DOCUMENT: MAD Apartments Emergency Procedures Policy
VERSION: 2.1  |  EFFECTIVE: January 2026

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SECTION 1 — WHAT QUALIFIES AS AN EMERGENCY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

An emergency is any fault, hazard, or situation that poses an immediate risk to the health, safety, or security of residents, or that causes serious damage to the property if not addressed within hours.

The following are classified as EMERGENCIES at MAD Apartments:

1. GAS LEAK — Any smell of gas inside or immediately outside the property. Treat as life-threatening. Do not use electrical switches. Evacuate and call the National Gas Emergency Service on 0800 111 999, then call MAD Apartments.

2. FIRE OR SMOKE — Any visible fire or smoke inside the building. Evacuate immediately via the nearest fire exit. Do not use the lift. Call 999 first, then MAD Apartments.

3. FLOODING OR BURST PIPE — Uncontrolled water flow inside the property that cannot be stopped by the tenant. Includes burst pipes, overflowing cisterns, or water entering from the floor or ceiling. Tenants should locate and turn off the stopcock (typically under the kitchen sink) if safe to do so.

4. TOTAL LOSS OF HEATING IN WINTER — Complete loss of heating between 1 November and 31 March. This is classified as an emergency under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 and the Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation) Act 2018. Response time: 4 hours.

5. TOTAL LOSS OF ELECTRICITY — All power cut to the property, not caused by the utility provider. Check the fuse board first. If the fault is building-side, it is an emergency.

6. STRUCTURAL DAMAGE — Collapse or serious risk of collapse of any structural element: ceilings, walls, floors, staircases, or balconies.

7. SECURITY BREACH — Forced entry, broken entry door locks, or compromised building access that leaves a tenant unable to secure their home. Includes a front door that cannot close or lock.

8. MEDICAL EMERGENCY — Any life-threatening medical situation. Call 999 first. MAD Apartments cannot provide medical assistance but will coordinate building access for emergency services.
